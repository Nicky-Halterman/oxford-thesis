# oxford-thesis

This is a repository for my undergraduate thesis at Oxford on civilian displacement. It includes a final draft, copies of the figures, and the code used to create the figures, perform the analysis, and create the appendices. Some of the original data (such as the UCDPGED data) is excluded due to file size limitations.
